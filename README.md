[paper-css] \(name pending revision\), is a CSS/Sass framework that provides tools for laying out printable documents with HTML. Origionally developed for resumes, this framework gives the user pixel-precise control over their documents. In situations where word processors are too limited and other typesetting languages are too complicated, [paper-css] provides an elegant solution, that is perfect for anyone with any kind of background in web-design.

## Usage

[paper-css] is still very much in alpha, and few features have been implemented. If you still wish to use the repository, there are two options:

### Gulp

First, run
```
npm install
```
to install dependancies, and then run
```
gulp
```
to compile and open a browser window with the index.html test file.

### CSS

You can also just use the paper.css file in paper/css. Importing this file will give all of the functionality of [paper-css].
